## Description:

This app demonstrates:

- usage of fetch to get data from a webserver
- define types of:
  - the json response body
  - props
  - return
- use async code with promise and then
- use useEffect with a dependency zone, to define when to call fetch and update the state
- use conditionals in jsx to show a spinner when data is loading and time if loading is finished
- share state (props) between components from parent to child
- use prettier and eslint to keep code readable
- use a bundler (vite) to build and develop with automatic reloading
- use a design framework (fluentui) to add some styling
